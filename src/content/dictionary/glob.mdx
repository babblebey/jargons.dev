In computing, **glob** (short for *global*) refers to a pattern-matching technique used to specify sets of filenames or paths using wildcard characters.

It’s most common in Unix-like shells (e.g., Bash, Zsh) and many programming languages. Instead of listing each file explicitly, you can use a *glob pattern* to match multiple files at once.

### Common Glob Patterns:

* `*` → matches zero or more characters

  * Example: `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`.
* `?` → matches exactly one character

  * Example: `file?.csv` matches `file1.csv`, `fileA.csv`, but not `file10.csv`.
* `[ ]` → matches any one character from inside the brackets

  * Example: `file[0-9].log` matches `file1.log` to `file9.log`.
* `{ }` → matches a comma-separated list of options (in some shells/languages)

  * Example: `*.{jpg,png}` matches all `.jpg` and `.png` files.
